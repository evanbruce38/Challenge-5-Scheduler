# Challenge 5 Work Day Scheduler
This challenge was given starter code I needed to create a calendar that automatitcally saves and updates when I add new events. This calendar is color coded to show what still needs to be completed. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as bootstrap and jquery.
